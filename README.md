#SKETCH IDEAS
* Using NFS NO LIMITS as a template for how the game will flow on screen 
* Modifications will be instead of a traditional car racing, our car is basically behaving like a self-driving uber/delivery vehicle
* this is what the challenges/obstacles will be structured around
* examples: 
Matt trains the car - punishment and reward.
Matt is the developer and you start designing the car.
traditional car owners set up obstacles becomes harder to navigate the terrain.
